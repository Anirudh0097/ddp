Introduction to PWLMOR
======================

This is a project which merges Dynamical systems with Electrical Engineering. We here realize that naive choice of state variables is not computationally efficient. We can come up with a linear combination of state variables which make describing the system much more efficient than it is right now.

This system has a 3D state space but is actually a 2D annular ring in 3D space. So we would not need all the three dimensions to describe this system. Rather a plane roughly passing through the annular ring will capture the details of the circuit.
